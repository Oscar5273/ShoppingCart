How to run program


I would recomend that you login to the buyer page or errors can occur when switching from seller to buyer. 

Buyer
1)After double clicking the executable you are presented with a login screen
2) You can either click on register to create  your own login by entering your information, you don't need to use yur actual address or credit card information. Or yu can also login with a premade loing with the username 'buyer1' 
and password 'Password1' 
3)On the buyer page you can click the "Add to Cart" button to add a certain product to your shopping cart.
You can also click "More Info" to open an info box for that specific item.
4) When done you can click the "Go To Cart" button to view the contents of you shopping cart. You can 
make changes to the quantity of the items in your cart y adjusting them in the provided field and clicking
update when ready. If you are ready for checkout you can simply click the "Checkout" button and your order 
complete. 
5) When you are done as a buyer you can click the logout button to return to the login screen.

Seller
1)To login as a seller you must enter the username 'seller1' and password 'Password1'.
2)On the seller mainpage you can change the quantity of your products by making changes in the field provided and
click edit. 
3)To delete a product you simply click on the delete button on the products panel.
4)To add a product just fill out the form provided and click Add Product.
5)When you are done you can logout.

Errors can occur throughout the seller page.
It is best to make quantity changes to existing products prior to adding a new product.

Errors can occur when deleting a product and trying to add more after.
